# REGEX TUTORIAL

In this tutorial, I'm going to introduce Regular Expressions and, by describing how it works, explain some important regex concepts.

## Summary

A regular expression or Regex is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

We will be walking through the following regex, explaining what each component does.

/^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/

This regex makes sure that the given string matches the template for an email address.
